BEFORE STARTING
==============

Prior to compilation you will need to make at least one edit (for the font
path) to the sera2latex resource file.  Other settings are optional.


ADJUSTING DEFAULTS
------------------

REQUIRED:
Where will you store your fonts?  On line 5 of the s2l.h file change
the font path "/u1/yacob/fonts/tex/" to where you choose to store your
Washra TeX fonts for Fidel.  DO NOT delete the quotation marks, " ",
around your font directory.  If you are not sure of your complete
directory name, type `pwd' from within the directory.


OPTIONAL:

You may change the default language rules by editing commenting out and
uncommenting the choices on lines 13-15 of the s2l.h file.  Tigrigna rules
are the default if no change is made.

The default font size may be reset from `10' on line 7 of the s2l file.
Other choices are 12, 14, 18, and 36.

The choice of phonetic symbology is adjustable by editing lines 109 
through 192 of the fidel.h file.


TO COMPILE
==========

To compile :

   % cd sera2latex
   % make 

You should now be ready to compile and print the files in
the "docs" directory.  Read the "README" file for usage
instructions.


SETTING UP FONTS
================

At the sera2latex development site, LaTeX insisted the Fidel fonts
be given the extension .300pk . If TeX or LaTeX want different
extension on your system, please link or rename the name accordingly
or edit line 11 of the s2l.h file to reset the extension used locally.
